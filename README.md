# Tasks list (ReactJs)
 This is a task list made with ReactOS. By now, it is static, but i intend to make it dynamic, using cookies and some API, or database. This repository has two projects. The "task-list" is a project made in react and it not uses Typescript. The "task-list-next" project uses NextJS and Typescript with ReactJS. Both projects do exactly same thing.
